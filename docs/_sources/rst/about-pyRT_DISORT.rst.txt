About pyRT_DISORT
=================
pyRT_DISORT originally started as a Python-based spiritual successor to
DISORT_MULTI---the brainchild of M.J. Wolff. The goal was to make radiative
transfer easier for myself by encapsulating logic into classes, allowing
anyone to perform retrievals by combining classes to build a model piece by
piece. All computations are performed using numpy, giving pyRT_DISORT the
speed of C while retaining the convenience of Python.

After some considerable work, I'm revolutionizing how approximately (1) people
do radiative transfer.

If you use this code in your research, please consider acknowledging the use of
this package in your paper. If you don't that's fine too, though it would be
nice to add your work to the known papers pyRT_DISORT helped create.
