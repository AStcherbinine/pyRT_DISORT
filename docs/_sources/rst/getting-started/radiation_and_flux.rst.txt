Radiation and Flux
==================

We need to specify the flux and thermal quantities used in the model, so let's
get right to it.

Incident Flux
-------------
We can define the beam flux and the isotropic flux at the top of the atmosphere
in the :class:`radiation.IncidentFlux` class. Instances of this class don't do
anything but containerize your desired flux, and provide some default values.
I'll go ahead and make an object and show its parameters.

.. literalinclude:: example_simulation.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 40-44

By default, :code:`beam_flux` is pi, and :code:`isotropic_flux` is 0. At least
for our Martian simulation, there's no real need to worry about the isotropic
flux from space.

Thermal Emission
----------------
We can also define whether thermal emission is used in the model with the
:class:`radiation.ThermalEmission` class. As before, pyRT_DISORT has default
values to get you up and running, though you can easily override them.

.. literalinclude:: example_simulation.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 46-50

By default, :code:`thermal_emission==False` and no other values are used. But
you're free to turn thermal emission on and add values for the boundaries.
