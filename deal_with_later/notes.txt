Conventions:
"read" if I'm reading in a file
"make" if I'm just making an object or defining a function
"calculate" if I'm doing math
"get" if I'm basically fetching a value
"check" if I'm making sure some value isn't crap

Altitudes are in km
Wavelengths are in microns
Everything else is in mks units













start on: hapke_subs.f

disort_multi files successfully ported over:
---aerosol_dust.dat
---aerosol_ice.dat
---get_column.f
---

disort_multi files NOT YET ported over:
---BDREF.f
---bdref_ls.f
---bdref_mcewen.f
---bdref_min.f
---bdref_multi.f
---bdref_multi_tilt.f
---conrath.f
---corrk_mds.f
---D1MACH.f
---DISORT.f (and I may not...)
---disort_multi.f
---ErrPack.f
---getmom.f

disort_multi files NOT ported over (reason):
---bilinear.f (just does linear interpolation; I use numpy/scipy)
---ChangeLog (only tracks changes; we have Git nowadays)
---DISORT.doc (this seems identical to the regular disort documentation)
---DISOTEST.doc (this seems identical to the other documentation)
---DISOTEST.f
---ERF.f (I just use scipy erf)
---getfits_xy.f (I transform .fits from astropy to numpy)\
---getfits_xy_stub.f (it doesn't seem necessary)


Assumptions so far
--- PHI0 is always 0
--- PHI is an array of length 1 (i.e. NPHI = 1 always)
--- SZA == Incidence angle
--- Every observation will have a single SZA, emission, and phase angle (i.e. I won't get a grid of numbers)
--- phsfn_98 is dust phase function Legendre coefficients and phsfn_99 is the same but for ice

Questions
--- Is phase function wavelength dependent? If so where is that stored? What wavelengths does phsfn_9[8,9] store?

To-do list:
--- Computers generally hate integrating large numbers, and I think I have a problem with the Gaussian quadrature
--- Add ability to input any combo of OD, SSA, PHSFN (z) in a file... or use my routines
--- tau_rayleigh isn't quite correct
--- Convert solar spectrum to microns
--- Figure out what are DISORT's output variables. Then remake the .so file
--- Make a good installation
--- Figure out what to do for SSA if the OD in a layer = 0. Right now I just divide by infinity
--- SSA has impossible values... probably related to the integration problem
--- add_aerosol is a terrible method name if I can't add anything from the Aerosol class
--- PMOM has the same problem with 0 in the denominator when dtauc or ssalb == 0
--- If n and N are specified in the input file, I need layer n and N so I need to interpolate
