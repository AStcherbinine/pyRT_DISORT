I tried two methods to auto-document this project. Both require a number of pre-requisites (... or at least I didn't
figure out another solution)

--- a python installation
--- pdoc3 or Sphinx installation. As far as I can tell, these use your computer's default python
--- The code it'll document needs to be an importable module. So every subdirectory needs to have __init__.py
--- Ex. in pyRT_DISORT I run <python setup.py build> and it creates a build folder of an importable module. I then
    move pyRT_DISORT (2 folders deep in the build folder) to ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages

1. pdoc3
--- To use pdoc3 just do <pdoc --html <path to pyRT_DISORT>. It will create an html folder in the current directory

2. Sphinx
--- To use Sphinx just do <sphinx-apidoc -o . <path to pyRT_DISORT>>. Then do <make html> and it will create index.html
    in _build/html
