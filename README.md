## pyRT_DISORT
pyRT_DISORT is a package for computing the arrays needed by DISORT. It 
provides:
* swappable vertical profiles, allowing streamlined construction of the
optical depth, single scattering albedo, and phase function arrays
* swappable surface profiles, including Lambertian and Hapke surface treatments
* generic radiative transfer utilities, such as decomposing empirical phase
functions into Legendre coefficients
* objects to create the flags required by DISORT
  
## Getting started
The best way to get started with pyRT_DISORT is to check out the documentation 
[here](https://kconnour.github.io/pyRT_DISORT/). It provides installation
instructions, example use cases, and documentation on everything included in
this project.

### Cautionary note
This project is under active development and is _unstable_ so many aspects of
the implementation are subject to change.

### Usage
After I'm a bit happier with the project I'll release it with a license; until
then, contact me if you plan to use this code. If this code helps with your 
research, please consider acknowledging the use of this package in your paper.
