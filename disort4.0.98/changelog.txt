Things I changed about DISORT to modify our needs:

--- in DISORT.f I added f2py code to inform it what the output variables should be. It does not modify the DISORT code
--- in DISORT.f I modified RHOU's 1st dimension to be MAXCMU instead of MAXUMU. This changes how DISORT works
--- in DISOBRDF.f I added f2py code to inform it what the output variables should be. It does not modify the DISOBRDF code
--- in DISOBRDF.f I changed REAL BRDF_ARG(4) to REAL BRDF_ARG(6)
--- In BDREF.f I added a 6th possible IREF value and its associated function
--- in BDREF.f I added a line REAL ASYM, FRAC, ROUGHNESS
--- in BDREF.f I changed BRDF_ARG(6) in the 1st line of code
