Fixes:

- Classes
--- Atmosphere has n = #/volume and is shorthand for "number". Need a consistent fix
--- There's a serious pointer problem with numpy arrays
--- Finish ModelAtmosphere + get it to run without errors...
--- Fix Observation properties. They should be all defined in the constructor
--- Make an output array class that defines arrays of 0s for DISORT
--- Make a Conrol class for PRNT, stuff like that
--- See if there's a better way than duck typing a PhaseFunction class
--- Column class should be updated to include a dtauc, ssalb, and/or pmom file

- Design
--- If tau_rayleigh isn't added and no columns are added, SSA will be 0... not a matrix. It'd be better to define it as
    a matrix, then add in Rayleigh, columns, etc.
--- Figure out what are DISORT's output variables. Then remake the .so file
--- Force all aerosols to have the same n_moments and wavelengths?

- Assumptions
--- Every aerosol will have a dust.npy-type file
--- I set dtauc = 10**-7 if it'd otherwise be less than that to avoid divide by 0 errors

- Bugs
--- PMOM doesn't seem right if the first coefficient is supposed to be 1
--- tau_rayleigh isn't quite correct... I think


Things to add:
--- Unit tests
--- Make a good installation
--- Add test cases for just Rayleigh scattering
--- Add Hapke phase function
