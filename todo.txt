Design
--- UU outputs a bunch of junk 0s in addition to "good" values---fix that?

Assumptions
--- Every aerosol will have a dust.npy-type file
--- ice.npy / dust.npy have the columns specified in the correct order
--- mars_atm.npy has the columns specified in the correct order
--- Every aerosol will either be HG or use a 3D phase function file

Test:
--- Make sure if I have 100 particle sizes, things don't go haywire...

Fix:
--- Remove old phase functions + generally unnecessary aux files

Work on next:
--- Mike's changes via email
--- Add an efficient solver
--- Make ice PMOM
no --> --- Ensure Column can accommodate different profiles for different particle sizes
yes --> --- Each aerosol column specify particle size for each layer
--- Ensure OD cannot be 0 since weights sum to 0
--- Add ozone
--- Unit tests
--- What happens when phase functions are defined at different wavelengths? Like dust and ice at short wavs
--- Thoroughly test __check_shapes_match() for 1D, 2D, and 3D phase functions
--- Combine radii + wavelengths into 1 phase function file
--- Change strings to f strings
--- Fix defining self.wavelengths / self.particle_sizes in PhaseFunction.expand_dimensions()
--- assert() might be better to raise ValueError('myMessage') or something
--- Move all the asserts in __init__ into a function since they just check the inputs are good
--- Add checks throughout to ensure the same wavelengths, moments, etc. are used. We don't want one aerosol observed
    at different wavelenghts than another. Also ensure they CAN have different r_effective
--- Postprocessing
--- Parallelize over wavelength / observations (pixels)
--- Correlated k?
--- T-matrix?
--- Set a max_moments in phase_functions.py in case user doesn't believe all the moments they have
--- Rewrite the test cases using my classes

Unresolved comments from the boss:
--- Layers/Boundaries
   - User should specify z vector that defines the boundaries of the layers. The input file is just the grid of EoS values
   - Interpolate EoS values onto this vector
   - Do integral in log(z) space
   - Maybe don't store midpoint values of the arrays (T_midpoint, P_midpoint, etc.)
   - the description of atmosphere array should be. "An array of the atmospheric state variables”. (i.e., P, temperature, number density, vertical coordinate) (minor wording change)

--- Column
   - The reference wavelength should be defined for each particle size. So change it from float --> np.ndarray

My grumbles
--- Aerosol
   - Handle dwaveref
   - Update docstring
   - Change the checker classes to print the variable name that's causing the error
   - Add aerosol file
   - Update the test
   - Remake documentation
   - Is there a better way besides telling the user the columns in the input file must be in a specified order?
   - Should there be a self.recreate() method? To update the aerosol's attributes if more info is provided?
