Additions:
--- Add an automatic linter
--- Add ability to run all unit/integration tests with one command
--- Can I get Github to automatically generate documentation when I push code?
--- Move path.py to the utilities folder
--- Update README.md
--- It still feels messy to me to have the disort4.0.99 stuff where it is
--- Make ice PMOM
--- Add ozone
--- Correlated k
--- T-matrix

Possible additions
--- Add an efficient solver
--- Parallelize over wavelength / observations (pixels)
--- Remake the DISORT examples with the new classes

Tests
--- What happens when phase functions are defined at different wavelengths? Like dust and ice at short wavs
--- Add checks throughout to ensure the same wavelengths, moments, etc. are used. We don't want one aerosol observed
    at different wavelenghts than another. Also ensure they CAN have different r_effective
--- Make sure if I have 100 particle sizes, things don't go haywire...

Next steps
--- Combine docs and builddocs
--- Update the dependencies in setup.py
--- Make a doc folder structure for rst files
--- Rename the integrated tests as "test1" etc. since there's really no way
    I can say what they're testing in the name. But do provide a docstring
    at the top that states specifically what it tests for. Also, now that I can
    do many pixels at once, I can combine a number of the tests.
