Things to start fixing:

--- A generalized aerosol should have all the dust methods. Clouds can have a Conrath profile evidently
--- Ozone isn't an aerosol but it needs added with the add_aerosol method to do dtauc correctly. So fix the naming
--- add_aerosol is a terrible method name if I can't add anything from the Aerosol class
--- Convert solar spectrum to microns
--- Computers generally hate integrating large numbers, and I think I have a problem with the Gaussian quadrature
--- tau_rayleigh isn't quite correct
--- Figure out what are DISORT's output variables. Then remake the .so file
--- Make an output array class that defines arrays of 0s for DISORT
--- Figure out what to do for SSA if the OD in a layer = 0. Right now I just divide by infinity
--- SSA has impossible values... probably related to the integration problem
--- PMOM has the same problem with 0 in the denominator when dtauc or ssalb == 0
--- If n and N are specified in the input file, I need layer n and N so I need to interpolate
--- Specify n_moments and only read/create phase functions with those number of moments

Things to add:
--- Make a good installation
--- Add test cases for just Rayleigh scattering
--- Add Hapke phase function
--- Add wavelength dependence for dtauc, ssa, pmom
--- Add ability to input any combo of OD, SSA, PHSFN (z) in a file... or use my routines
--- Add classes that encapsulate numpy/scipy functions
