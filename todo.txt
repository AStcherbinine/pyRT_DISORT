Misc:
- fix eos Raises bullet points
- test if pip installs the tests directory (it does)
- attempt to recombine docs and builddocs

Refresh part 2:
--- Remake the integration tests to conform with pytest
--- Remake the untested utilities + tests + guide

User's guide part 2:
--- Add info on the new utilities

Documentation:
--- try to make a dummy index.html so docs can all be on one folder
--- Have "next" and "previous" only go through the example
--- Can I remove the .pytest_cache once I'm done with all tests?
--- Put links to each class/function on the left hand menu for the API page
--- I want to add an Attributes section but can't figure out how to make
    Sphinx not complain
--- Perhaps I never noticed it but it seems odd that it puts documentation in
    ../../../../../../../home/<wherever>
--- The Warning and See also sections have a grey bar that extends too long

Additions:
--- Add an automatic linter
--- Add ability to run all unit tests with one command (see tox)
--- It still feels messy to me to have the disort4.0.99 stuff where it is
--- Correlated k

Tests:
--- Rename the integrated tests as "test1" etc. since there's really no way
    I can say what they're testing in the name. But do provide a docstring
    at the top that states specifically what it tests for. Also, now that I can
    do many pixels at once, I can combine a number of the tests.

Suggestions
--- disort wrapper with defaults
--- Change defaults in the boolean classes? Or none at all
--- user levels --> output arrays
--- Add __str__
