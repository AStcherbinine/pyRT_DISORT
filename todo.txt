Things to start fixing:
- Aerosols
--- Fix PMOM to have wavelength dependence + check correctness
- Fix classes
--- If n and N are specified in the input file, I need layer n and N so I need to interpolate
--- Specify n_moments and only read/create phase functions with those number of moments
--- Fix Observation properties. They should be all defined in the constructor
--- Make an output array class that defines arrays of 0s for DISORT
--- After everything else above is done, remove unnecessary files
--- I need a phase function class to clean up Aerosol. It might be best to assume a dust.npy-type file will always
    be provided
- Bug testing
--- Computers generally hate integrating large numbers, and I think I have a problem with the Gaussian quadrature
--- tau_rayleigh isn't quite correct
--- Figure out what are DISORT's output variables. Then remake the .so file
--- If tau_rayleigh isn't added and no columns are added, SSA will be 0... not a matrix. It'd be better to define it as
    a matrix, then add in Rayleigh, columns, etc.
- Considerations
--- I set dtauc = 10**-7 if it'd otherwise be less than that
--- SSA = 0 sometimes, which causes problems for PMOM

Things to add:
--- Unit tests
--- Make a good installation
--- Add test cases for just Rayleigh scattering
--- Add Hapke phase function
--- Add ability to input any combo of OD, SSA, PHSFN (z) in a file... or use my routines
--- Add classes that encapsulate numpy/scipy functions
