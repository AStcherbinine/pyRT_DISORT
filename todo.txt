Fixes:

- Classes
--- Update docstrings for consistency. Add things like output array shape, z_layer --> altitude_layer, etc for consistency
--- Fix Observation properties. They should be all defined in the constructor
--- Make an output array class that defines arrays of 0s for DISORT
--- Make a Conrol class for PRNT, stuff like that
--- See if there's a better way than duck typing a PhaseFunction class
--- Column class should be updated to include a the ODs for that aerosol (I think... have to make sure it matches the z values in atmosphere)
--- ModelAtmosphere should be updated to include dtauc, ssalb, and/or pmom file

- Design
--- If tau_rayleigh isn't added and no columns are added, SSA will be 0... not a matrix. It'd be better to define it as
    a matrix, then add in Rayleigh, columns, etc.
--- Figure out what are DISORT's output variables. Then remake the .so file
--- Force all aerosols to have the same n_moments and wavelengths?
--- Right now model.calculate_moments is a mess. I should be able to do RT on an atmosphere with just rayleigh scattering.
    Currently it requires a column to exist and is dependent on the 0th column
--- "generic" seems like a poor folder name for the main routines

- Assumptions
--- The empirical phase function is wavelength independent. I know this is wrong... but it's all I have for now
--- Every aerosol will have a dust.npy-type file
--- ice.npy / dust.npy have the columns specified in the correct order
--- mars_atm.npy has the columns specified in the correct order

- Bugs
--- PMOM doesn't seem right if the first coefficient is supposed to be 1
--- "Input variable PMOM in error"
--- tau_rayleigh isn't quite correct... I think

- Generic
--- Try a Rayleigh only test case
--- Get dtauc/ssalb/pmom from disort_multi + compare to mine

Questions:
--- What are the 2 additional columns in ice?


Things to add:
--- Unit tests
--- Make a good installation
--- Add test cases for just Rayleigh scattering
--- Add Hapke phase function
--- Solver
--- Gas---I presume ozone shouldn't use any of the aerosol column methods
--- I generally do linear interpolation but it'd be nice if the user could specify fancier interpolations
