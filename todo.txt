Fixes:

- Design
--- Fix n_moments + n_wavelengths in pmom. I had to change code structure to accommodate no column
--- Right now model.calculate_moments is a mess. Currently it requires a column to exist and is dependent on the 0th column
--- Force all aerosols to have the same n_moments and wavelengths?
--- UU outputs a bunch of junk 0s in addition to "good" values---fix that
--- I should consider just updating tau_rayleigh everytime a rayleigh component is added so the user never needs
    to remember to compute total tau rayleigh. Though, as written, that's not efficient
--- See if there's a better way than duck typing a PhaseFunction class
--- It'd be nice to have a Rayleigh class but it may have a duck typing issue too
--- ModelAtmosphere should be updated to include a possible dtauc, ssalb, and/or pmom file

- Assumptions
--- The empirical phase function is wavelength independent. I know this is wrong... but it's all I have for now
--- Every aerosol will have a dust.npy-type file
--- ice.npy / dust.npy have the columns specified in the correct order
--- mars_atm.npy has the columns specified in the correct order

Questions:
--- I must have some confusion about nlayers... if I have 15 boundaries, I have 14 layers so I thought dtauc, and ssalb
    should be of length 14 but his are 15. His are also reversed compared to mine
--- Do moments go from 0--127 or 1--128? Just checking when dividing my (2k+1)
--- What are the "requirements" on PMOM? I think it just breaks if any value is >1
--- In disort_multi, if there's only Rayleigh scattering, ssalb = 0.99, not 1. Shouldn't it be 1? See line 1714 of
    disort_multi if tau_ice = tau_dust = tau_ozone = 0
--- How to specify layers besides reading them in from marsatm.inp? He uses 40-->; I use 15
--- What are the 2 additional columns in ice?
--- Where would I add Type 1 or 2 ice?
--- Where would I add effective radius?
--- What are pivot pressures/altitudes/temperatures?
--- How important is corr-k?

Things to add/test:
--- Unit tests
--- Make a good installation
--- Add Hapke surface phase function
--- Solver
--- Gas---I presume ozone shouldn't use any of the aerosol column methods
--- I generally do linear interpolation but it'd be nice if the user could specify fancier interpolations
--- Mike does post-DISORT processing, multiplying UU by scaling. I should copy that for all disort-multi outputs
