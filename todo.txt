Fixes:

- Classes
--- See if there's a better way than duck typing a PhaseFunction class
--- ModelAtmosphere should be updated to include a possible dtauc, ssalb, and/or pmom file

- Design
--- If tau_rayleigh isn't added and no columns are added, SSA will be 0... not a matrix. It'd be better to define it as
    a matrix, then add in Rayleigh, columns, etc. so I could do a calculation with just Rayleigh scattering
--- Right now model.calculate_moments is a mess. Currently it requires a column to exist and is dependent on the 0th column
--- Remake the .so file with the output class variables all being output
--- Force all aerosols to have the same n_moments and wavelengths?
--- "generic" seems like a poor folder name for the main routines. It might be nice to make "model" and miscellaneous
    folder for Control, Output, etc.

- Assumptions
--- The empirical phase function is wavelength independent. I know this is wrong... but it's all I have for now
--- Every aerosol will have a dust.npy-type file
--- ice.npy / dust.npy have the columns specified in the correct order
--- mars_atm.npy has the columns specified in the correct order

- Bugs
--- PMOM doesn't seem right if the first coefficient is supposed to be 1
--- "Input variable PMOM in error"
--- tau_rayleigh isn't quite correct... I think

Questions:
--- What are the 2 additional columns in ice?


Things to add/test:
--- Unit tests
--- Make a good installation
--- Add test cases for just Rayleigh scattering
--- Get dtauc/ssalb/pmom from disort_multi + compare to mine
--- Add Hapke surface phase function
--- Solver
--- Gas---I presume ozone shouldn't use any of the aerosol column methods
--- I generally do linear interpolation but it'd be nice if the user could specify fancier interpolations
