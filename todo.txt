Design
--- UU outputs a bunch of junk 0s in addition to "good" values---fix that?
--- Specify layers independent of mars_atm.inp?
--- Make a good installation

Assumptions
--- Every aerosol will have a dust.npy-type file
--- ice.npy / dust.npy have the columns specified in the correct order
--- mars_atm.npy has the columns specified in the correct order

Questions:
--- What are the "requirements" on PMOM? I think it just breaks if any value is >1
--- In disort_multi, if there's only Rayleigh scattering, ssalb = 0.99, not 1. Shouldn't it be 1? See line 1714 of
    disort_multi if tau_ice = tau_dust = tau_ozone = 0
--- What are the 2 additional columns in ice?
--- What are pivot pressures/altitudes/temperatures?
--- How important is corr-k for prioritization?
--- Should PMOM_aerosol have a layer dependence? Right now I make it constant in the layers
--- Are all the phase functions I have for dust? Where is 0.8 microns?

Bugs:
--- Now that I added r_eff, the HG phase function doesn't have the correct shape

Additions:
--- Add checks throughout to ensure the same wavelengths, moments, etc. are used. We don't want one aerosol observed
    at different wavelenghts than another. Also ensure they CAN have different r_effective
--- Rayleigh
--- Add InterpPhaseFunction
--- Add HGPhaseFunction
--- Unit tests
--- Add Hapke surface phase function (already defined in BDREF.f, I just need BRDF_TYPE=1)
--- Solver
--- Gas---I presume ozone shouldn't use any of the aerosol column methods
--- I generally do linear interpolation but it'd be nice if the user could specify fancier interpolations
--- Mike does post-DISORT processing, multiplying UU by scaling. I should copy that for all disort-multi outputs

Test:
--- Make sure if I have 100 particle sizes, things don't go haywire...
--- Check that PMOM_Rayleigh is 0.1, not 0.1 / (2k+1)

Fix:
--- nearest_neighbor_phase_function doesn't slice efficiently... consider np.take()
--- In EmpiricalPhaseFunction, "legendre_moments" might be better than "phase_function" since they're not phase functions
