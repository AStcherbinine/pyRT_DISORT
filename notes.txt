Assumptions so far
--- PHI0 is always 0
--- PHI is an array of length 1 (i.e. NPHI = 1 always)
--- SZA == Incidence angle
--- Every observation will have a single SZA, emission, and phase angle (i.e. I won't get a grid of numbers)
--- phsfn_98 is dust phase function Legendre coefficients and phsfn_99 is the same but for ice

Questions
--- Where do I get albedo?
--- Is phase function wavelength dependent? If so where is that stored? What wavelengths does phsfn_9[8,9] store?
