Welcome to pyRT_DISORT's documentation
======================================
Thank you for actually taking the time to check out my documentation!
pyRT_DISORT is a collection of tools that help make radiative transfer easier
by performing many of the pre-processing steps needed to create the arrays
required by DISORT. There's no one way to do radiative transfer, so this
package is designed to just provide tools to make your life easier, assuming
you combine them in a useful way. If you're a first time user, I suggest you
check out :doc:`rst/getting-started`, where I walk through an example of how use
this package with Martian dust.
