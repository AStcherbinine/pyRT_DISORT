User's Guide
============

This user's guide will walk you through how to install pyRT_DISORT and use it
to simulate reflectance spectra of an atmosphere containing Martian dust. Then,
we'll use these simulations to parallelize our code and perform a retrieval.
I'll also demonstrate some not-strictly-necessary features included in
pyRT_DISORT that may make your life easier.

Each step will show off one of the modules included in pyRT_DISORT. For an
in-depth look at them, check out :doc:`api-reference`.
