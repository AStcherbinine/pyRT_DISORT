About pyRT_DISORT
=================

What it is
----------
pyRT_DISORT is a collection of functions and classes that help make radiative
transfer easier by streamlining many of the pre-processing steps needed to run
a retrieval. These are tailored to DISORT, but many utilities are general
purpose.

Papers using pyRT_DISORT
------------------------

* Another one derives the dust: Ultraviolet dust aerosol properties retrieved
  from MAVEN/IUVS data (under review)

If you use this code in your research, please consider acknowledging the use of
this package in your paper. If you don't that's fine too, though it would be
nice to add your work to the known papers pyRT_DISORT helped create.
